# Fantasy Football 2025 Fee Tracker

## **🎊 LIVE PRODUCTION SYSTEM - SEPTEMBER 10, 2025 DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS**

A comprehensive Fantasy Football fee tracker built using Supabase and Deno. It integrates with the Sleeper API to process weekly fees, calculate penalties, and send notifications via Discord with automated GitHub Actions workflows.

## 🚀 Project Status: **FULLY OPERATIONAL - 2025 SEASON LIVE** 

### **🎉 SEPTEMBER 10, 2025 - FINAL DEPLOYMENT SESSION COMPLETED**
- **✅ AUTHENTICATION**: Fresh tokens deployed and working
- **✅ LIVE LEAGUE**: Successfully transitioned to 2025 league (ID: `1249067741470539776`)
- **✅ DISCORD NOTIFICATIONS**: Re-enabled and sending rich notifications
- **✅ TRANSACTION FEE BUG**: **CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED** - Fixed double-processing of transactions
- **✅ AUTOMATED SCHEDULING**: Ready for Tuesday 2 AM EST runs
- **✅ WEEK 1 VALIDATION**: Complete processing confirmed with $20 total fees

### **🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIX - Transaction Fee Logic (September 10, 2025)**
**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: System was processing ALL season transactions every week, causing incorrect fee charges for players with remaining free transactions.

**ROOT CAUSE**: Transaction processing loop was decrementing free transaction counts for already-processed transactions, resulting in fees being charged when they should be free.

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: 
- Added transaction filtering to only process NEW transactions not already in database
- Enhanced logging to show exactly which transactions are new vs already processed
- Preserved existing upsert logic to prevent duplicate database entries

**BEFORE FIX**: Watts52 charged $12 in transaction fees despite having 4 free transactions remaining
**AFTER FIX**: Watts52 correctly charged $0 in transaction fees

**DEPLOYMENT**: Version 6+ deployed with transaction fee fix
