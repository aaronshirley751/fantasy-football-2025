Great idea! Let me use the MCP GitHub tools to get a comprehensive view of the repository and understand the current project state. Now let me check the recent commits and search for any enhanced function files: Now let me search for any enhanced function files that might exist in the git history: Let me check the current index.ts file to understand the current state: Now let me check if there are any GitHub Actions workflows: Now let me check the current project README from GitHub: Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the project state. Let me create a comprehensive summary of the current project status and next steps.

# ðŸ“Š **Fantasy Football 2025 Project Review & Next Steps**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current Project Status: PRODUCTION READY**

Based on my review through GitHub MCP, here's the complete project state:

### âœ… **What's Deployed & Working**
1. **Core System (FULLY OPERATIONAL)**
   - Supabase project: `jfeuobfjgqownybluvje` 
   - Edge function deployed and tested with real data
   - Discord notifications working with rich embeds
   - Database schema complete with all required tables
   - TypeScript support with custom Deno types

2. **Automation (FULLY OPERATIONAL)**
   - GitHub Actions workflow for scheduled processing
   - Runs every Tuesday 2 AM EST after Monday Night Football
   - Manual trigger capabilities with week number input
   - End-to-end testing confirmed via Discord notifications

3. **Data Processing (FULLY OPERATIONAL)**
   - Loss fees: $5 per matchup loss
   - Transaction fees: $1 per waiver/trade from Sleeper
   - Inactive player penalties: $2 per inactive starter
   - High scorer bonus tracking
   - Real-time Sleeper API synchronization

### ðŸŸ¡ **What's Ready But Not Deployed**
The README mentions an "enhanced function with UTF-8 encoding issue" - however, **I found no `index_enhanced.ts` file in the repository**. This suggests either:
1. The enhanced function was never committed to git
2. It exists only locally on your machine
3. The README documentation is outdated

## ðŸŽŠ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Priority 1: Locate Enhanced Function**
The README mentions advanced features that are "ready but blocked by UTF-8 encoding error":
- Enhanced Discord notifications with owner names (not roster IDs)
- Detailed fee breakdowns by type (loss/transaction/penalty)
- Free transaction logic (first 10 per roster)
- Mulligan system (first inactive player free per roster)
- Season-to-date fee summaries

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Check if enhanced function exists locally
cd "C:/Users/tasms/my-new-project/fantasy-football-2025"
find . -name "*enhanced*" -o -name "*backup*"
```

### **Priority 2: Enhance Current Function**
Since no enhanced function exists in the repository, we need to **implement the enhanced features** mentioned in the README:

1. **Add User Name Mapping**
   - Fetch user data from Sleeper API
   - Map roster_id to actual display names
   - Update Discord notifications to show "John Smith" instead of "Roster 4"

2. **Implement Free Transaction Logic**
   - Track transaction count per roster per season
   - First 10 transactions free per roster
   - Apply fees only after the free limit

3. **Add Mulligan System**
   - Track inactive player penalties per roster
   - First inactive player free per roster per season
   - Apply penalties only after the first occurrence

4. **Enhanced Discord Notifications**
   - Detailed fee breakdowns by type
   - Season-to-date summaries
   - Better formatting with actual owner names

### **Priority 3: Test Enhanced Features**
1. Deploy enhanced function
2. Test with real league data
3. Verify Discord notifications show improvements
4. Validate free transaction and mulligan logic

## ðŸ”§ **Development Environment Setup**

To resume development, ensure you have:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "C:/Users/tasms/my-new-project/fantasy-football-2025"

# Verify Supabase connection
npx supabase status

# Check current function deployment
npx supabase functions list
```

## ðŸ“‹ **Enhancement Implementation Plan**

### **Step 1: Add User Mapping (30 minutes)**
```typescript
// Add to fetchSleeperData function
async function fetchUserMapping(supabase: any, leagueId: string, sleeperUsers: any[]) {
  // Store/update users in database
  // Return roster_id to display_name mapping
}
```

### **Step 2: Free Transaction Logic (45 minutes)**
```typescript
// Add transaction counting
async function getTransactionCount(supabase: any, leagueId: string, rosterId: number) {
  // Count transactions for current season
  // Return whether roster has exceeded free limit
}
```

### **Step 3: Mulligan System (30 minutes)**
```typescript
// Add inactive player tracking
async function checkMulliganStatus(supabase: any, leagueId: string, rosterId: number) {
  // Check if roster has used their mulligan
  // Return whether penalty should be applied
}
```

### **Step 4: Enhanced Discord (45 minutes)**
```typescript
// Update sendDiscordNotification function
// Add detailed breakdowns and owner names
// Include season-to-date summaries
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Metrics**

When enhanced features are complete, you'll see:
- âœ… Discord notifications with actual names: "John Smith owes $7 (Loss: $5, Penalty: $2)"
- âœ… Free transactions: "Aaron used 8/10 free transactions"
- âœ… Mulligan system: "Mike used inactive player mulligan"
- âœ… Season summaries: "Total season fees: $127"

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Resume?**

The project is in excellent shape with a solid foundation. The core system is production-ready and working. The next phase is implementing the enhanced user experience features that will make the Discord notifications much more user-friendly and feature-rich.

Would you like me to start implementing these enhanced features, or would you prefer to check for any existing enhanced function files first?
