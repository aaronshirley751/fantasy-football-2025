## íº€ **System Architecture**

**Current Production Stack:**
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized fantasy league schema
- **APIs**: Sleeper API for league data, Discord webhooks for notifications
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions for scheduled processing
- **Frontend**: Discord-based notifications and Supabase dashboard

## í³Š **Current Database Schema**

```sql
-- Core tables (ALL DEPLOYED & WORKING)
leagues          -- League configuration with Discord webhooks
users            -- Team owner mapping (roster_id â†’ username)
matchups         -- Weekly results and high scorer tracking
transactions     -- Waiver/trade fees from Sleeper API
inactive_penalties -- Lineup violation tracking
fee_summary      -- Running totals per roster with breakdowns
```

## í¾Š **START HERE: Next Session Tasks**

### íº¨ **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Enhanced Function Deployment**

**Issue:** Enhanced function with all advanced features ready but blocked by UTF-8 encoding error during deployment.

**What's Ready:**
- Enhanced Discord notifications with owner names (not roster IDs)
- Detailed fee breakdowns by type (loss/transaction/penalty)
- Season-to-date fee summaries per roster
- Free transaction logic (first 10 per roster)
- Mulligan system (first inactive player free per roster)
- Complete enhanced function saved as `index_enhanced.ts`

**Required Action:**
1. Fix UTF-8 encoding issue in enhanced function
2. Deploy enhanced version successfully
3. Test all new features with real data
4. Verify free transaction counting works correctly
5. Confirm mulligan system activates properly

### í³‹ **Session Continuation Steps**

1. **Encoding Fix & Deploy**
   ```bash
   cd "C:/Users/tasms/my-new-project/fantasy-football-2025"
   # Fix encoding in supabase/functions/process-weekly-fees/index_enhanced.ts
   # Deploy: npx supabase functions deploy process-weekly-fees
   ```

2. **Feature Validation**
   - Test enhanced Discord notifications
   - Verify owner name mapping works
   - Confirm free transaction logic
   - Validate mulligan system

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update this README with enhanced features
   - Create user guide for new functionality
   - Document business rules (10 free, 1 mulligan)

### í´ **Key Files for Next Session**

- `supabase/functions/process-weekly-fees/index_enhanced.ts` - Complete enhanced function
- `supabase/functions/process-weekly-fees/index.ts` - Current working production version
- `.github/workflows/weekly-fee-processing.yml` - Automation workflow
- Database needs no changes - all tables ready for enhanced features

### í²¡ **Known Working Configuration**

**Environment Variables Set:**
- SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY configured
- GitHub Repository Secrets: SUPABASE_FUNCTION_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- Discord webhook URLs stored in database

**Validated League Setup:**
- Test league UUID: `d06f0672-2848-4b5d-86f5-9ab559605b4f`
- Discord notifications confirmed working
- All core processing logic tested and functional

---

> **Success Metric:** When enhanced function deploys successfully, you'll see Discord notifications with actual owner names like "John Smith owes $7 (Loss: $5, Penalty: $2)" instead of "Roster 4 owes $7"
