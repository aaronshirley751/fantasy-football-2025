# Fantasy Football 2025 Fee Tracker - Weekly Processor Production System

## **� WEEKLY INCREMENTAL PROCESSOR DEPLOYED - SEPTEMBER 25, 2025**

A **production-ready** Fantasy Football fee tracker featuring incremental weekly processing that maintains cumulative transaction data across the entire season. Built with Supabase Edge Functions, Deno, and real-time Discord notifications.

## 🚀 **PRODUCTION STATUS: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

### **✅ SEPTEMBER 25, 2025 - WEEKLY PROCESSOR BREAKTHROUGH SESSION**
- **🔄 INCREMENTAL PROCESSING**: Only processes NEW transactions each week - maintains cumulative data
- **⚡ SUB-SECOND EXECUTION**: 400-600ms processing time for weekly cron jobs
- **📊 REAL LEAGUE DATA**: Processing $32/week with 10 active teams and real owner names
- **💾 DATABASE PERSISTENCE**: Proper schema integration with transactions + fee_summary tables
- **📱 DISCORD NOTIFICATIONS**: Rich formatting with transaction status and rolling totals
- **🎯 PRODUCTION VALIDATION**: Comprehensive auditing confirms system ready for live operation

### **🏆 Current Live League State (Week 3 Results)**
- **Total Weekly Fees**: $32.00
- **High Scorer Bonus**: BeanerDipp earned -$5 (204.04 points)
- **Transaction Leaders**: Watts52 & tscotty85 (used all 10 free transactions)
- **Loss Fees**: 4 teams with $5 weekly loss penalties
- **System Performance**: 402ms execution time, 0 new transactions processed (all existing data properly maintained)

### **🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIX - Transaction Fee Logic (September 10, 2025)**
**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: System was processing ALL season transactions every week, causing incorrect fee charges for players with remaining free transactions.

**ROOT CAUSE**: Transaction processing loop was decrementing free transaction counts for already-processed transactions, resulting in fees being charged when they should be free.

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: 
- Added transaction filtering to only process NEW transactions not already in database
- Enhanced logging to show exactly which transactions are new vs already processed
- Preserved existing upsert logic to prevent duplicate database entries

**BEFORE FIX**: Watts52 charged $12 in transaction fees despite having 4 free transactions remaining
**AFTER FIX**: Watts52 correctly charged $0 in transaction fees

**DEPLOYMENT**: Version 6+ deployed with transaction fee fix 

### ✅ **Phase 1 - Core System (COMPLETED)**
- [x] Supabase project setup and configuration
- [x] Edge function development (`process-weekly-fees`)
