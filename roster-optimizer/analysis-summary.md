## 🎯 Top 4 Add/Drop Recommendations

### PRIORITY 1: 🔥 MUST DO
**ADD**: Kareem Hunt (RB - KC)  
**DROP**: Trey Benson (RB - ARI)  
**FAAB BID**: $15

**Why This Move?**
- ✅ Trey Benson is on IR - wasted roster spot
- ✅ Kareem Hunt is trending heavily (likely got playing time recently)
- ✅ Chiefs RB always has value in fantasy
- ✅ Immediate roster upgrade at no real cost

**Risk**: MEDIUM - Hunt's role may fluctuate but he's healthy and active

---

### PRIORITY 2: 🚨 CRITICAL - ADD DST
**ADD**: Las Vegas Raiders (DEF) or Jacksonville Jaguars (DEF)  
**DROP**: N/A (use bench spot or stream weekly)  
**FAAB BID**: $3-5

**Why This Move?**
- ❌ You currently have NO defense rostered
- ✅ Both trending defenses available
- ✅ Essential to field a complete lineup

**Risk**: LOW - Must add a defense immediately

---

### PRIORITY 3: 💡 CONSIDER
**ADD**: David Njoku (TE - CLE)  
**DROP**: Mason Taylor (TE - NYJ)  
**FAAB BID**: $8

**Why This Move?**
- ✅ Njoku is trending heavily (likely had a big game)
- ✅ Better upside than Taylor
- ✅ Tucker Kraft remains your TE1

**Risk**: MEDIUM - Evaluate if the upgrade is worth the FAAB spend

---

### PRIORITY 4: 🤔 OPTIONAL
**ADD**: Kendrick Bourne (WR - SF)  
**DROP**: Ladd McConkey (WR - LAC)  
**FAAB BID**: $12

**Why This Move?**
- ⚠️ **CAUTION**: You have a strong WR corps
- ✅ Bourne trending (49ers WR can have big weeks)
- ❌ McConkey is a solid depth piece - evaluate carefully

**Risk**: MEDIUM - May not be necessary given your WR strength

---

## 📅 Bye Week Planning

✅ **GOOD NEWS**: No bye weeks currently showing for your roster!

This means you won't have forced lineup decisions in the immediate future. Use this time to:
- Add depth where needed
- Stream DST matchups
- Target high-upside free agents

---

## 🔄 Streaming Strategy

### DST Streaming (IMMEDIATE NEED):
1. **Las Vegas Raiders** 🔥 - Trending
2. **Jacksonville Jaguars** 🔥 - Trending  
3. **Houston Texans** - Solid option

**Recommendation**: Add Raiders or Jaguars immediately. Check their Week 6 matchup and upcoming schedule.

### QB Streaming (If Needed):
Your QB situation is stable with Caleb Williams, but if he underperforms:
- **Joe Flacco** (CIN) 🔥 - Trending, veteran option
- **Sam Darnold** (SEA) 🔥 - Trending, high upside

---

## 💰 FAAB Budget Strategy

**Current Budget**: Likely $100 (need to confirm remaining)  
**Recommended Week 6 Spending**: $20-30 total

### Suggested Allocation:
- **Kareem Hunt**: $12-15 (priority RB add)
- **DST (Raiders/Jags)**: $3-5 (essential)
- **David Njoku**: $8-10 (if you want TE upgrade)
- **Reserve**: Keep $60-70 for rest of season

---

## 🎯 Action Items for This Week

### MUST DO:
1. ⚠️ **Add a Defense** - You can't play without one!
2. ✅ **Drop Trey Benson** - He's on IR, wasted roster spot
3. ✅ **Add Kareem Hunt** - Immediate upgrade

### SHOULD CONSIDER:
4. 💡 Evaluate David Njoku vs Mason Taylor
5. 💡 Monitor Kendrick Bourne's situation (don't rush this)

### MONITORING:
6. 📊 Track Caleb Williams performance
7. 📊 Watch D'Andre Swift's usage in Chicago
8. 📊 Keep eye on Ashton Jeanty's rookie development

## 🏆 Outlook & Strategy

**Current Situation**: 2-3 record, need to start winning now  
**Roster Strength**: Strong WR/RB corps, adequate QB/TE  
**Critical Weakness**: NO DEFENSE! 🚨  

**Winning Strategy**:
1. **Fix the defense gap immediately** - Can't win without fielding a full team
2. **Leverage WR strength** - Jefferson + Adams is an elite 1-2 punch
3. **RB depth is good** - Swift/Dowdle/Jeanty gives you options
4. **Stay aggressive on waivers** - You need wins, target high upside

**Season Outlook**: With Jefferson and Adams, you have championship-level WRs. Fix the defense, stay healthy, and you can make a playoff push. The 2-3 start isn't ideal but you have the talent to turn it around.
