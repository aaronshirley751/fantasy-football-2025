## 🚀 **Enhanced Feature #1: Owner Names Testing**

### [ ] **3. Owner Name Validation**
- [ ] Execute function with test league data
- [ ] Verify Discord notifications show actual owner names (e.g., "John Smith")
- [ ] Confirm no roster IDs appear in notifications (e.g., no "Team 3")
- [ ] Check database `users` table for proper user mappings
- [ ] Validate user mapping persistence across multiple runs

**Expected Result:** Discord shows "John Smith owes $7" instead of "Team 3 owes $7"

### [ ] **4. Database User Mapping Check**
- [ ] Query `users` table for roster_id → username mappings
- [ ] Verify Sleeper API user data is properly fetched and stored
- [ ] Confirm user mappings update when league roster changes
- [ ] Check that `owner_name` field appears in all fee records

---

## 💰 **Enhanced Feature #2: Free Transaction System Testing**

### [ ] **5. Free Transaction Logic Validation**
- [ ] Identify roster with transaction activity this season
- [ ] Verify function calculates correct transactions_used count
- [ ] Confirm free_transactions_remaining displays accurately
- [ ] Test that fees only apply after free limit (5) is exceeded

### [ ] **6. Free Transaction Discord Notifications**
- [ ] Look for "[FREE]" indicator in transaction notifications
- [ ] Verify remaining count displays: "[FREE] waiver (4 remaining)"
- [ ] Confirm free transactions don't generate fee charges
- [ ] Test transition from free to paid transactions

**Expected Results:**
- First 5 transactions per roster show "[FREE] waiver (X remaining)"
- Transactions 6+ show normal fee: "John Smith: waiver transaction ($1)"

### [ ] **7. Transaction Database Verification**
- [ ] Check `transactions` table for proper transaction_type and fees
- [ ] Verify `fee_summary` only includes actual fees (not free transactions)
- [ ] Confirm transaction stats calculations are accurate
- [ ] Validate season-long transaction tracking per roster

---

## 🎲 **Enhanced Feature #3: Mulligan System Testing**

### [ ] **8. Mulligan Logic Validation**
- [ ] Identify roster with inactive player penalties this season
- [ ] Verify first inactive player per roster gets mulligan (fee = $0)
- [ ] Confirm subsequent inactive players incur normal $2 penalty
- [ ] Check that mulligan status persists per roster per season

### [ ] **9. Mulligan Discord Notifications**
- [ ] Look for "[MULLIGAN]" indicator in inactive player notifications
- [ ] Verify mulligan message: "[MULLIGAN] Free inactive player: PlayerName"
- [ ] Confirm mulligan penalties don't generate fee charges
- [ ] Test that subsequent inactive players show normal penalties

**Expected Results:**
- First inactive player per roster: "[MULLIGAN] Free inactive player: PlayerName"
- Subsequent inactive players: "John Smith: Inactive player: PlayerID ($2)"

### [ ] **10. Mulligan Database Verification**
- [ ] Check `inactive_penalties` table for mulligan records (fee = 0)
- [ ] Verify `fee_summary` excludes mulligan penalties from totals
- [ ] Confirm mulligan tracking persists across multiple weeks
- [ ] Validate only one mulligan per roster per season

## 📋 **SESSION STATUS UPDATE - January 27, 2025**

### 🎯 **Current Progress**
- [✅] **Infrastructure Confirmed**: Version 5 deployed, authentication working, functions responding
- [✅] **Debug Tools Created**: `debug-league` function deployed for league configuration inspection
- [⚠️] **BLOCKER IDENTIFIED**: Sleeper API connectivity/data availability issue

### 🚧 **Active Challenge**
**Issue**: Function executes successfully (`{"success":true,"fees":{"fees":[],"highScorer":null}}`) but returns empty data
**Root Cause**: Need to verify actual `sleeper_league_id` stored in database vs UUID being used
**Context**: 2025 preseason may have no matchup data, but should have user/roster data

### 🎯 **START HERE NEXT SESSION**
1. **Execute debug function**: Test `debug-league` to see actual stored Sleeper league ID
2. **Validate API connectivity**: Resolve why direct Sleeper API calls are hanging
3. **Data verification**: Fetch actual team names and validate league data availability
4. **Complete testing**: Once API data flows, test all enhanced features with real data

### 📝 **Test Commands Ready**
```bash
# Debug league configuration
curl -X POST "https://jfeuobfjgqownybluvje.supabase.co/functions/v1/debug-league" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]" \
  -d '{"league_id": "d06f0672-2848-4b5d-86f5-9ab559605b4f"}'
```

**Session Result**: ✅ Infrastructure Ready | ⚠️ API Connectivity Issue | 🎯 Ready for Resolution
