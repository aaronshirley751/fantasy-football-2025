üö® ANALYSIS: POTENTIAL ROSTER MANAGEMENT ISSUE
================================================================================

KEY OBSERVATIONS:
1. All 14 transactions are "free_agent" type but only involve DROPS
2. All occurred within a 1-minute window on 8/22/2025
3. No corresponding "adds" - just mass player drops
4. This pattern suggests roster cleanup/purge activity

QUESTIONS FOR INVESTIGATION:
1. Were these legitimate roster cleanup drops?
2. Should "drop-only" transactions count toward the 10 free limit?
3. Was this part of post-draft roster management?
4. Are these correctly classified as "free_agent" transactions?

COMPARISON WITH OTHER TEAMS:
================================================================================

Roster 2 (Turd_Ferguson24): 14 similar drop-only transactions on 8/21/2025
Roster 6 (Watts52): Mix of normal add/drop transactions 
Roster 7 (tscotty85): Mix of normal add/drop transactions

BUSINESS LOGIC QUESTION:
================================================================================

Should the fee system count "drop-only" transactions toward the 10 free limit?

Arguments FOR counting them:
- They are processed through the waiver/free agent system
- They free up roster spots which has strategic value
- Sleeper API classifies them as "free_agent" type

Arguments AGAINST counting them:
- No actual player acquisition occurred
- May be post-draft roster cleanup
- Different from typical waiver wire activity

RECOMMENDATION:
================================================================================

1. IMMEDIATE: Clarify with league rules whether drop-only transactions count
2. If they DON'T count: Update fee logic to only count transactions with "adds"
3. If they DO count: Current calculation is correct ($8 owed per team)

UPDATED FEE CALCULATION (if drop-only transactions don't count):
- SaladBar751: 0 add transactions = $0 owed ‚úÖ
- Turd_Ferguson24: 0 add transactions = $0 owed ‚úÖ  
- All other teams: No fees owed ‚úÖ

Would result in $0 total fees for pre-season.
