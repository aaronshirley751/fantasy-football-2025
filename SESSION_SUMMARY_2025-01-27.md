# Session Summary - January 27, 2025
## Live Testing Progress & Challenges

### Session Objectives
- Continue live testing of enhanced Fantasy Football tracker features
- Fetch actual team names from Sleeper API 
- Validate what data is being returned from the Sleeper API for our league
- Test enhanced features: owner names, free transactions, mulligan system

### Progress Made ‚úÖ

#### 1. Function Deployment Status
- **Version 5 Confirmed Active**: Enhanced function (495 lines) successfully deployed to production
- **Authentication Working**: Service role key authentication verified and functional
- **Function Connectivity**: Edge function responding successfully to requests
- **Response Format**: Function returns `{"success":true,"fees":{"fees":[],"highScorer":null}}`

#### 2. Code Analysis Completed
- **Database Integration**: Confirmed function correctly looks up league config from `leagues` table
- **API Integration**: Function uses `league.sleeper_league_id` (not UUID) for Sleeper API calls  
- **Data Flow**: `fetchSleeperData()` function fetches users, rosters, matchups, transactions
- **User Mapping**: `createUserMappings()` processes Sleeper users/rosters for owner names

#### 3. Debugging Infrastructure Created
- **Debug Function**: Created `debug-league` edge function to inspect league configuration
- **Deployment Ready**: Debug function deployed successfully to production
- **Test Commands**: Curl commands prepared for testing both functions

### Key Challenge Identified ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### **Primary Issue: Sleeper API Data Discrepancy**
- **Function Success**: Our function executes successfully and returns structured response
- **Empty Results**: All Sleeper API calls returning empty/no data for league UUID `d06f0672-2848-4b5d-86f5-9ab559605b4f`
- **API Hanging**: Direct curl commands to Sleeper API endpoints timing out or hanging
- **Season Context**: Currently in 2025 preseason (August 20, 2025) - may explain empty matchup data

#### **Root Cause Analysis Needed**
1. **League ID Validation**: Need to verify what actual `sleeper_league_id` is stored in database vs UUID
2. **Season Compatibility**: Determine if league is 2024 or 2025 season
3. **API Connectivity**: Resolve why Sleeper API calls are hanging during testing
4. **Data Availability**: Check if league has users/rosters regardless of matchup data

### Technical Assets Ready üõ†Ô∏è

#### **Enhanced Function Features (Deployed)**
```typescript
// Version 5 includes:
- TransactionStats interface for free transaction tracking
- UserMapping interface for owner name resolution  
- getTransactionStats() for mulligan system logic
- Enhanced processMatchupsAndFees() with all features
- Discord notification with rich embeds
```

#### **Debug Tools Available**
- `debug-league` function for league configuration inspection
- Test curl commands for both main and debug functions
- Service role authentication confirmed working

#### **Database Schema Understanding**
- League config stored in `leagues` table with `sleeper_league_id` field
- Function correctly maps UUID to actual Sleeper league ID
- Database lookup mechanism working (confirmed by successful function execution)

### Next Session Action Plan üéØ

#### **IMMEDIATE START HERE**
1. **Resolve API Connectivity**: 
   - Test `debug-league` function to see actual stored `sleeper_league_id`
   - Verify Sleeper API is accessible and league ID is valid
   - Use timeout settings for API calls to prevent hanging

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Fetch actual league data to see team names and user information
   - Test with 2024 season data if 2025 preseason has no data
   - Validate that Sleeper league ID corresponds to expected league

3. **Live Testing Completion**:
   - Once API data is flowing, test all enhanced features:
     - Owner name resolution
     - Free transaction counting  
     - Mulligan system logic
   - Create mock scenarios with actual team data

#### **Test Commands Ready to Execute**
```bash
# Debug league configuration
curl -X POST "https://jfeuobfjgqownybluvje.supabase.co/functions/v1/debug-league" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"league_id": "d06f0672-2848-4b5d-86f5-9ab559605b4f"}'

# Test main function with different weeks
curl -X POST "https://jfeuobfjgqownybluvje.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-weekly-fees" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [SERVICE_ROLE_KEY]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"week_number": 17, "league_id": "d06f0672-2848-4b5d-86f5-9ab559605b4f"}'
```

### Files Modified This Session
- `supabase/functions/debug-league/index.ts` - New debug function created
- `supabase/functions/debug-league/deno.json` - Debug function configuration
- Enhanced function confirmed deployed as Version 5

### Session Context for Continuation
- **Working Directory**: `C:/Users/tasms/my-new-project/Fantasy Football 2025/fantasy-fee-tracker`
- **Project ID**: `jfeuobfjgqownybluvje` 
- **League UUID**: `d06f0672-2848-4b5d-86f5-9ab559605b4f`
- **Function Status**: All functions deployed and authentication working
- **Blocker**: Sleeper API connectivity/data availability needs resolution
